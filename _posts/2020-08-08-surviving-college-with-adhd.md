My strategy with ADHD has always been to counteract the internal chaos with tons of external structure in my life. The times when I've been "my best self" were when I was the busiest, but I think a large part of that is because when my life gets insane, I have no choice but to **calendar everything**, and this has always been what works best for me. I calendar things like
- Wake up
- Go to sleep
- Eat breakfast / lunch / dinner
- Shower
- Work on analysis for 3 hours
- Sections / classes (of course)
- Play Diablo 3 for 2 hours (this is more of a maximum than a minimum)
- etc.

I've found that this works best when I have a **really** persistent alarm for each item. I'd love to find an app that integrates with my Google calendar and nags me every 5 minutes until I stop snoozing it, but for now I just set a lot of alarms in the Clock app of my iPhone.

When I'm using a calendar system like this and following it, I'm free to hyperfocus on whatever I'm doing at the moment, because my phone will tell me when it's time to stop and go to the next thing. This is where a persistent alarm comes in handy, because often when I'm sucked in to a project, I'll go "Yeah yeah just a second" and snooze the alarm in my pocket. This is okay as long as it's planned for, and as long as the alarm will tell me again in a few minutes "DUDE YOU NEED TO STOP". For this same reason, I also plan for travel time (pre-covid anyways), and always allow way more time than is strictly necessary to get there.

For more long-term projects, I've worked through the process in [Getting Things Done by David Allen][3]. It was first written many years ago, but it's a totally timeless system and there are tons of great apps out there designed to eliminate the pen-and-paper aspect of things (I use [any.do](https://www.any.do/) these days). To do it the "right" way, you'll need to set 3-5 days completely aside to get your whole work life organized. I've done this twice in the past 15 years or so, and found it extremely worthwhile both times.

Regarding medication, everyone's experience is different, and I am *in no way* qualified to give advice about this, so I won't. Instead, I'll just share my experience with medication. I was first diagnosed in 4th grade and I was given Dexedrine, but my parents decided not to keep me on it. Around this time, I also did EEG biofeedback treatment at the Drake Institute. Biofeedback is an ADHD treatment which seemed to work well for me and others, but [as far as I can tell][1] it has [been needing further study][2] for about 20 years. Basically you watch your own brainwaves on a monitor and try to stay focused and calm, and the monitor shows your brainwaves so you can see how you're doing. That seemed to give some lasting improvement, and I wasn't medicated again until I was 19, when I went on Vyvanse for college. This *sort of* helped, but my doctor did me a huge disservice by letting me decide my own dosage (is that even ethical?). I gave myself a humongous dosage, abused it a lot, and eventually just stopped filling my prescriptions. These days I take 200mg of caffeine every morning and most afternoons, and that's it.
